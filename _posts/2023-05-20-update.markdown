This is my attempt to post a minor life update, six months into the creation of this webpage.

Since then, I managed to get an internship, move to a different city and experience a bit of what it feels like to be an adult (at least on the outside).

This affair has indeed consumed a lot of time I used to put into things, like learning and sleeping - nowadays I am just able to focus on the latter.

Within a few months, I will be graduating college as well. I hope that goes smoothly.

I will try to post my ramblings more often here though, or simply write about things I think are cool.
